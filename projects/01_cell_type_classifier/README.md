# Cell Type Classifier

## Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify cells by type based on gene expression data from the CZI CELLxGENE Census.

## Goals
- Fetch human blood cell data from the Census.
- Preprocess the expression matrix.
- Train a classifier (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to predict cell types.
- Evaluate model performance.

## Setup
Ensure you have the `cellxgene-census` package installed.

```bash
pip install cellxgene-census scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

## Usage
(Instructions to be added)
